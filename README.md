### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Tweeddalex/Tweeddalex** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an incentivized SSI project called cheqd, enabling payments to be made in exchange for verified identities
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic code
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on governance, and specifically, decentralised governance
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning more about code and Github communities
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything SSI, governance or data protection related!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: alex@cheqd.io
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once won a dune buggy race against the King of Jordan in the Wadi Rum dessert... :D
